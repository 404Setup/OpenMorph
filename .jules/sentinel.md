## 2026-06-25 - Restricted Blocks Enhancement
**Vulnerability:** Players could morph into blocks like TNT, Lava, or Water and "solidify" them into the world, bypassing protection plugins because `MorphBlock` uses `block.setType()` instead of firing `BlockPlaceEvent`.
**Learning:** Plugins that directly modify the world state without firing Bukkit events (like `BlockPlaceEvent`) bypass all other plugins that listen to these events for protection (e.g., WorldGuard, GriefPrevention). Manual restrictions are required in these cases.
**Prevention:** Always fire relevant Bukkit events when modifying the world in response to player actions, or explicitly check for permissions/regions if events cannot be fired. In this case, we expanded the `RestrictedBlocks` blacklist to cover dangerous materials.
